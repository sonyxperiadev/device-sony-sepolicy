# GSIs still ship with this label on /firmware, which is marked as bug
# b/36764215 over at AOSP. The symlink should not be used and all our
# platforms have ueventd firmware_directories extended in
# /vendor/uevent.rc to direct to /vendor/firmware_mnt/image/, yet
# /firwmare is searched first due to:

# Hide this denial as any use of the link is misleading and wrong:
